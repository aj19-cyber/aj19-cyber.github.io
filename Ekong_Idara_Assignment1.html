            <p> My name is Idara Ekong and Im Nigerian. I was born and raised in Nigeria and I 
                am the only child of my parents. I am 17 years old but no one actually seems to
                believe that information. I concider myself to be a very open person, I love to chat,
                meet new people, eat, Listen to music and lastely I am a christian. Well you've read
                the basics, now lets Get into my Education.

    <h4>EDUCATION</h4>
    <p>From the Introduction can see that I was born and raised in Nigeria In the city of Lagos.
        I started school at the age of 3 at Saint Benedict. I cant quite remember much about
        the school but i will always remember it for its fun and all inclusive activities.
        I strictly remember a game of pick and count the beans, fumny times. 
    </p>
    </section>
    
    <p>Going up to primary school I had amazing friends and teachers and We used to do these
       fun projects every week and I frankly remember the time i couldn't spell the word
       English and I used to spell it as Inglish. In primary school you have 6 years but i 
       only did 5 and i skipped the sixth because in Nigeria it is relatively normal to
       skip grade 6 and I was like why not.
        </p>
        <p> Highschool, Rather Secondary school as we call it In Nigeria was quite a roller
            coaster! I wasn't really popular or every the pretty girl. In my fist year of 
            secondary school I was quite a gullible person, people always said i was too
            kind but thats the only life i ever really knew. Going to senior school I finally found 
            myself and who my friend really were, Secondary school was basically a make or break
            situation. There are alot of people who pretend to be your friends but dont even
            like you, we call those (<span class="colouredword">FAKE FRIENDS!</span> )

            <h2>This is a Picture of Amala and Ewedu</h2>
            <p>This is my favorite food, Amala and Ewedu, a traditional Nigerian dish. It consists of yam flour dough
                 (Amala) served with a delicious green stew made from Jute leaves (Ewedu). Itâ€™s a favorite for many
                  Nigerians and especially enjoyed with meat or fish.</p>

            <h3>Picture of the Buses in Lagos</h3>
            <p>This is a typical image of the buses in Lagos, Nigeria. They are a popular mode of public 
                transportation in the city. The buses can often be crowded, but they are a crucial part of 
                the daily commute for many people living in Lagos.</p>
