            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I was born in Northern Samar, Philippines, and moved to Red Deer, Canada, at the age of 10. Now at 19, I am pursuing a diploma in Commputer Programming at Red Deer Polytechnic. I graduated at Lindsay Thurber on 2023, and took a gap year to figure out the course that I would take. Although Computer Programming was not on my mind to pursue just until recently as I was thinking about pursuing Business at first, I ultimately chose this path because of I had been interested in technology (although not on a very deep level) and I enjoy playing games a lot. I hope to learn more about this course in the future! </p>
