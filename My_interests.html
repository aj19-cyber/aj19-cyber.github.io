            <h2>My interests</h2>
            <p>I listen to many different genres of music, which is why having my airpods on me at all times is an absolute must. Listening to music is very thereupatic for me and gives me motivation to move throughout the day. I also try to workout as often as I can because I recently gotten more serious about my physical health, for me to increase my overall stamina as I get tired very easily. I watch organizing videos when I want to feel motivated about cleaning my room because its very calming for me. I watch 10 minutes youtube videos everytime I eat and it has become a part of my routine ever since I was younger. I am also interested in Editing, I think it is a very cool skill that I want to learn more about and get good at doing it. That being said my interests are not all long-lasting, I might be interested in one thing for a week or two and then completely lose interest.   </p>
