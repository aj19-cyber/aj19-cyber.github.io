                        <p> My name is Idara Ekong and Im Nigerian. I was born and raised in Nigeria and I 
                            am the only child of my parents. I am 17 years old but no one actually seems to
                            believe that information. I concider myself to be a very open person, I love to chat,
                            meet new people, eat, Listen to music and lastely I am a christian. 
                            "Growing up as an African girl means being surrounded by vibrant traditions, from colorful
                            fabrics to lively dance moves that bring any gathering to life."
                            "I take pride in my African name, which carries a deep meaning and connects me to my roots.
                            In Africa, we don’t just have nuclear families—we have an entire village that raises us! Aunties, 
                            uncles, and even neighbors all play a role in shaping who we are."
                            "Family gatherings are never quiet; they are filled with laughter, storytelling, and, of course, 
                            food that makes your taste buds dance."
                            "Well you've read the basics, now lets Get into my Education.

                        <h2 class="head2">MY EDUCATION</h2>
                        <h4>EDUCATION</h4>
                        <p>From the Introduction can see that I was born and raised in Nigeria In the city of Lagos.
                            I started school at the age of 3 at Saint Benedict. I cant quite remember much about
                            the school but i will always remember it for its fun and all inclusive activities.
                            I strictly remember a game of pick and count the beans, fumny times. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Going up to primary school I had amazing friends and teachers and We used to do these
                            fun projects every week and I frankly remember the time i couldn't spell the word
                            English and I used to spell it as Inglish. In primary school you have 6 years but i 
                            only did 5 and i skipped the sixth because in Nigeria it is relatively normal to
                            skip grade 6 and I was like why not.
                        </p>
                        <p> Highschool, Rather Secondary school as we call it In Nigeria was quite a roller
                            coaster! I wasn't really popular or every the pretty girl. In my fist year of 
                            secondary school I was quite a gullible person, people always said i was too
                            kind but thats the only life i ever really knew. Going to senior school I finally found 
                            myself and who my friend really were, Secondary school was basically a make or break
                            situation. There are alot of people who pretend to be your friends but dont even
                            like you, we call those (<span class="colouredword">FAKE FRIENDS!</span> )
                        </p>

                <h2>This is a Picture of Amala and Ewedu</h2>
                <p>
                    This is my favorite food, Amala and Ewedu, a traditional Nigerian dish. It consists of yam flour dough
                    (Amala) served with a delicious green stew made from Jute leaves (Ewedu). It’s a favorite for many
                    Nigerians and especially enjoyed with meat or fish.

                <h3>Picture of the Buses in Lagos</h3>
                <p>This is a typical image of the buses in Lagos, Nigeria. They are a popular mode of public 
                    transportation in the city. The buses can often be crowded, but they are a crucial part of 
                    the daily commute for many people living in Lagos.</p>
