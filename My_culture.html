            <h2>My Culture</h2>
             <p>Growing up in the Philippines for the first ten years of my life has given me irreplacable memories and experiences, a place I call home. My filipino culture is a big part of my identity, the languange, the people, the cuisine, and so much more is something that I will always want to have in my life. My home environment allows these things to be present in my daily life, because my family pretty much makes filipino food almost daily and we speak mixed languages that helps me not forget our mother tongue. When I went back for a 1 month vacation to the Philippines for my 17th birthday,I once again relived the first ten years of my life. Even with the huge difference in weather compared to Canada, it was somewhat familiar to be standing under the scorching sun and the stormy windy rainstorms. </p>
