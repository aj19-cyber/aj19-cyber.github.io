                I'm an international student at Red Deer Polytechnic, currently in my first year of Computer Programming Diploma. </p>

                        <p> 
                            I came from Manila, Philippines, where I completed my high school at the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest existing university in Asia. 
                            During my senior high school, I chose to specialize in the Music, Arts, and Design strand, which developed my appreciation for the field of art. 
                            I gained knowledge about various artistic disciplines and learned about renowned artists, such as painters and musicians. 
                            This led me to know about the works of Claude Monet, who became my favorite painter.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I don't have many hobbies, but I enjoy taking photos with my Nikon Coolpix digital camera. It captures more sentimental images than my phone camera does.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I also used to attend concerts of my favorite artists; I find it more fun to hear their songs live and experience the concert production. 
                            I've also learned to play bowling, which I enjoy even more if I have the chance to play it more often.

                    <p>
                        My ultimate goal is to reach a point where I feel genuinely comfortable and content. I want to live my days feeling genuine happiness, 
                        where it is a consistent companion rather than a fleeting feeling. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also aspire to have a life in which everything does not seem like a luxury, 
                        especially when it comes to traveling to foreign places. I want to explore the world and see places I only see on screen. It would help me to go 
                        beyond my four walls and be open to what may come in my life.
                    </p>

                    <P>
                        Overall, being at peace is a privilege I want to attain the most.
