            <p>I was born in Northern Samar, Philippines, and moved to Red Deer, Canada, at the age of 10. Now at 19, I am pursuing a diploma in Computer Programming at Red Deer Polytechnic. I graduated at Lindsay Thurber in 2023 and took a gap year to figure out the course that I would take. Although Computer Programming was not initially on my mind, I ultimately chose this path because I had been interested in technology (though not on a very deep level) and enjoy playing games. I hope to learn more about this course in the future!</p>

            <p>I listen to many different genres of music, which is why having my airpods on me at all times is an absolute must. Listening to music is very therapeutic for me and gives me motivation to move throughout the day. I also try to work out as often as I can because I recently got more serious about my physical health to increase my overall stamina. I watch organizing videos when I want to feel motivated about cleaning my room because it's very calming for me. I watch 10-minute YouTube videos every time I eat, and it's become a part of my routine ever since I was younger. I am also interested in editing, which I think is a very cool skill that I want to learn more about and get good at. However, my interests aren't always long-lasting, and I may lose interest in something after a week or two.</p>

            <p>Growing up in the Philippines for the first ten years of my life has given me irreplaceable memories and experiences, a place I call home. My Filipino culture is a big part of my identity, the language, the people, the cuisine, and so much more are things I will always want to have in my life. My home environment allows these things to be present in my daily life because my family makes Filipino food almost daily and we speak a mix of languages that helps me not forget our mother tongue. When I went back for a one-month vacation to the Philippines for my 17th birthday, I relived the first ten years of my life. Even with the huge difference in weather compared to Canada, it was familiar to stand under the scorching sun and the stormy, windy rainstorms.</p>
